LinkedIn Talent Migration Data Visualization

Overview:
This timeseries (2015 â€“ 2019) dataset is part of the LinkedIn - World Bank Group partnership. It consists of migration instances defined as a LinkedIn member changing the location on their LinkedIn profiles. The figures are normalized by LinkedIn member counts for each country, country-industry, and country-skill to enable fair comparisons across samples.

Data description:
Data is available at the country, country-industry, and country-skill level with 4K, 5K, and 20K rows and 13 columns. The unit of measure used is the Migration rate per 10,000 LinkedIn members. The data is suitable for visualization as it includes hierarchical, categorical (Country, Income range), and numerical data (float and int). A quick peek at the data reveals that the country-skill level data requires substantial cleaning and normalizing to maintain data integrity. But the country and country-industry data need nominal cleaning.

Abstract:
After cleaning the data, the objective is to understand rapidly evolving labor markets with detailed and dynamic insights. To achieve this objective, efforts to take a closer look at data, study inter-dependencies, and analyze trends, if any, will be put forth. Appropriate analysis and visualization can result in allowing leaders to benchmark and compare labor markets across the world; analyze skills, occupations, migration, and industries; and leverage real-time data to make policy changes. 

Deliverables:
The project will conclude with a presentation and analysis report consisting of code used and adequate visualizations to fulfill the objective as described in the abstract.
